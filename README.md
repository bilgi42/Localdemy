# Localdemy

This is an open source program for tracking progress for learning material that you obtained. It is completely local, doesn't send any data to anyone. It lists folders and videos under folders alphabetically. It currently only supports linux and I am not sure for other platforms

# Disclaimer 

This project was written with an LLM for most of the time. The only reason for its existence is my personal need and I just wanted to publish it to Github. If you want to contribute, fork or anything, you are absolutely free to, but I am not sure whether or not I will update this program in the future or not.
